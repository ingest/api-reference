## Notes

* Listing videos is a paginated operation and also currently supports title-based searching via the query parameter search. As well, this operation accepts a query parameter to filter records based on status. This parameter can be comma-separated for multiple status values. By default the returned records will be filtered by status of `draft, published`.
